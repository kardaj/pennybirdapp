PennyBird operates with a "your data is your data" policy. I don't ever want apps to collect and sell my data, so I don't collect and sell yours. Here's how PennyBird handles your personal data: PennyBird stores all your expense tracking data locally on your device. Your data is not transmitted or stored outside of your device.
