# Terms of Use

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the PennyBird application ("PennyBird" or "Application") operated by Hassene Ben Salem ("I" or "me").
By accessing and using PennyBird, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Application. I may modify these Terms and the Privacy Policy at any time, and such modification will be effective upon posting to the Application.

## Privacy Policy
PennyBird operates with a "your data is your data" policy. I don't ever want apps to collect and sell my data, so I don't collect and sell yours. Here's how PennyBird handles your personal data:
PennyBird stores all your expense tracking data locally on your device. Your data is not transmitted or stored outside of your device.

## Intellectual Property
PennyBird is owned and operated by Hassene Ben Salem. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Application provided by me are protected by French and international copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. Except for any content that are provided and owned by Users, all materials contained on the Application are the property of me or my subsidiaries or affiliated companies and/or third-party licensors. All trademarks, service marks, and trade names are proprietary to me or my affiliates and/or third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by me, you agree not to sell, license, distribute, copy, modify, publicly perform or display, transmit, publish, edit, adapt, create derivative works from, or otherwise make unauthorized use of the materials. I reserve all rights not expressly granted in the Terms.

## Limitation of Liability
In no event shall I, nor my partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Application; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Application; (iii) any content obtained from the Application; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

## Representations and Warranties
Your use of the Application is at your sole risk. The Application is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Application is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.
I do not warrant that the Application will function uninterrupted or will be available at any particular time or location.

## Updates to these Terms
At times it may be necessary for me to make changes to the Terms such as due to changes in the services I offer, Apple's policies and procedures, and/or the applicable laws of France. I reserve the right to update or modify the Terms at any time without prior notice. Please review the Terms periodically.
The Terms were last updated on the date indicated below. Any changes to the Terms will become effective upon posting to the Application. As set forth above, your continued use of the Application after any changes or revisions to the Terms shall indicate your acceptance and agreement with such revised Terms.

## Governing Law
Any claim relating to PennyBird shall be governed by French law. In the event of a dispute that cannot be settled amicably, the Commercial Court of Bordeaux shall have sole jurisdiction.
